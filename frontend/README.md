## 🧑‍💻 Getting started

There are no formal blockchain or Web 3 prerequisites for this tutorial, but you should have some experience with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Having said that, you can certainly complete the tutorial if you at least know basic [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). You might just find it more difficult to follow the app's pre-built functionality.

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed. Then clone the repo and run the `yarn` command to install the app dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/figment-networks/wallet-tutorial.git
cd wallet-tutorial
yarn
```

## 💻 Running the development server

Start the Next.js development server on the default port 3000 with:

```
yarn dev
```

> Alternatively, run `yarn dev -p 8080` or any port other than `8080` to start the server in a different port.

Once the server is running, you should see output that looks like this:

```
yarn run v1.22.11
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Using webpack 5. Reason: Enabled by default https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5
event - compiled successfully
```

You can now view the running application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
